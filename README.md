# Boston Accessilble Trip Guides
This app gives guides that allow users to look up stations and travel routes between MBTA Subway Lines, as well as the busy Providence/Stoughton Commuter Rail line. In addition to this, the app  
provides alerts whenever a station that the user would access would not be accessible.  
News articles are linked at the footer of every page.
